# Module-5-Challenge-Third-Party-API

For this week's challenge, we were given the task of creating a workday scheduler that includes timeblocks of standard business hours, the current date and time. With these timeblocks, they are color coordinated to reflect the current time of the day. Grey being past time, red being current, and green being future. They are also made to have inputs in them and when the scheduler is reflected, the inputs remain.
